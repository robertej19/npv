Negative and Positive predictive values are quantities formed from 3 independent variables. The math is interesting and straightforward, but is not usually presented as such. So here is an attempt at a clearer illustration. No equations here, just (hopefully) helpful plots, or at least more helpful than what is above. The point is to get across a feeling of <b><i>why</i></b> these quantities work the way they do, instead of just teaching how to calculate them. Negative Predictive Values (<b> NPV </b>) and Positive Predictive Values (<b>PPV</b>) are both functions of 3 variables:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b> Prevalence </b> - how many people have it
<li><b> Sensitivity </b> - how many people that have it will test positive
<li><b> Specificity </b> - how many people that don't have it will test negative
</ul>

	<br>
    	<br>

<p align="center" style="font-size:18px">A perfect test would be 100% sensitive and 100% specific, but this doesn't exist. If it did, testing positive would mean you can be 100% certain you have the disease, and testing negative would mean you can be 100% certain you do not have the disease. But since tests are imperfect, you need more values - PPV and NPV - to describe statistically how likely it is that a test gave you the wrong result:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b> PPV </b> - given that I tested <b> positive </b> what is the probability I <b> actually do </b> have it
<li><b> NPV </b> - given that I tested <b> negative </b> what is the probability I <b> actually do not</b> have it
</ul>

	<br>
	<br>
<p align="center" style="font-size:18px">
In each case, it is just the probability that the result of the test is correct. NPV and PPV can be described with numbers and formulas, but it is hard to get a feeling for what is really going on that way. Its a lot easier to look at nice pictures. In the plots below, we can calculate NPV and PPV in the following ways:
</p>
<ul align="center" style="font-size:18px">
<li><b> PPV </b> - ~Ratio of Red to Blue in positive tests. Red represents sick patients testing positive, blue represents healthy patients testing positive. The fraction of red to all positive tests is exactly PPV.
<li><b> NPV </b> - ~Ratio of Green to Orange in negative tests. Green represents healthy patients testing negative, orange represents sick patients testing negative. The fraction of green to all negative tests is exactly NPV.
</ul>

Other notes on navigating the plots below: The first plot contains all the information you need, the rest are just fun duplicates. There are sliders which allow you to vary the prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity. Pay attention to what changes and what never changes when each slider is moved. Pay attention to the range of PPV and NPV values you can achieve by varying the three variables. And most importantly try to get a feel for why PPV and NPV behave like they do. Finally, the colored bar on each of the three below plots shows how the population would be divded into the four groups of sick, healthy, positive and negative testing.

<p align="center" style="font-size:18px">Here is the same information, but presented as circles instead of lines, because it looks nicer, and at least one person found it easier to understand this way. Circles provide a particularly intuitive sense of PPV and NPV - given you tested  positive (in the upper left circle), what is the probability that you are actually sick (in the red part of the circle)? This is just PPV, and it is just the ratio of the red area to the total circle area. Similarly, NPV is the probability that, given you are in the upper right circle, that you are in the green part of the circle. No math is needed to get a feel for these concepts.

Footer: 1: Yes, its prevalence, not prevalance. 2: The formatting on this page is not great. It might be improved in the future if there exists sufficent cause.
