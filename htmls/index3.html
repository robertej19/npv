Negative and Positive predictive values are quantities formed from 3 independent variables. The math is extremely straightforward and should not be confusing. Instructors need to not shy away from the math; you are training advanced medical professionals, if I can't trust them with 3 variables how am I supposed to trust them with my life. PA students are extremely capable of basic math and it is belittling to treat them otherwise. The alternative to being taught poorly on purpose is that no one knew how to teach it properly. Not having medical professionals decently mathematically literate is a <a href="https://fliptomato.wordpress.com/2007/03/19/medical-researcher-discovers-integration-gets-75-citations/"><i><b>problem</b></i></a>. The honus falls on the math and the teaching communities to improve it. So here is an attempt.

No equations here, just (hopefully) helpful plots, or at least more helpful than what is above. Negative Predictive Values (<b> NPV </b>) and Positive Predictive Values (<b>PPV</b>) are both functions of 3 variables:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b> Prevalence </b> - how many people have it
<li><b> Sensitivity </b> - how many people that have it will test positive
<li><b> Specificity </b> - how many people that don't have it will test negative
</ul>
<p align="center" style="font-size:18px">A perfect test would be 100% specific and 100% specific, but this doesn't exist. Because of this, we also need NPV and PPV to get the full picture of what a test is telling us:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b> PPV </b> - given that I tested <b> positive </b> what is the probability I <b> actually do </b> have it
<li><b> NPV </b> - given that I tested <b> negative </b> what is the probability I <b> actually do not</b> have it
</ul>

<p align="center" style="font-size:18px">
NPV and PPV can be described with numbers and formulas, but it is hard to get a feeling for what is really going on that way. Its a lot easier to look at nice pictures. In the plots below, we can calculate NPV and PPV in the following ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b> PPV </b> - ~Ratio of Red to Blue in positive tests. Red represents sick patients testing positive, blue represents healthy patients testing positive. The fraction of red to all positive tests is exactly PPV.
<li><b> NPV </b> - ~Ratio of Green to Orange in negative tests. Green represents healthy patients testing negative, orange represents sick patients testing negative. The fraction of green to all negative tests is exactly NPV.
</ul>
<p align="center" style="font-size:18px">
Other notes on navigating the plots below: There is a slider which allows you to vary the prevalence (first plot), sensitivity (second plot) and specificity (third plot). Ideally there would be 1 plot with 3 sliders instead of 3 plots each with 1 slider. But there isn't. In any case, pay attention to what changes and what never changes in each different plot. Pay attention to the range of PPV and NPV values you can achieve by varying the three variables. And most importantly try to get a feel for why PPV and NPV behave like they do. Finally, the colored bar on each of the three below plots shows how the population would be divded into the four groups of sick, healthy, positive and negative testing.

<p align="center" style="font-size:18px">Here is the same information, but presented as circles instead of lines, because it looks nicer, and at least one person found it easier to understand this way.

Footer: 1. Yes, its prevalence not prevalance. Sue me. 2. The formatting on this page is crap. It might be improved in the future if there exists ample motivation.
